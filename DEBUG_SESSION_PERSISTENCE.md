# Debug Session Persistence Issue

## 🎯 Problem
When you refresh the frontend page after logging in, it redirects to the login page instead of staying logged in.

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### 1. Removed Duplicate Authentication Checks
- **Problem**: Both layout and login/register pages were calling `checkAuth()`
- **Fix**: Removed authentication checks from login and register pages
- **Result**: Only the layout handles authentication checking

### 2. Added Detailed Logging
- **Problem**: No visibility into what's happening during authentication
- **Fix**: Added console logs throughout the authentication flow
- **Result**: Can now see exactly where the process fails

### 3. Fixed Layout Authentication Logic
- **Problem**: Complex logic with `authChecked` flag was preventing proper redirects
- **Fix**: Simplified authentication check logic
- **Result**: Cleaner, more reliable authentication flow

## 🧪 How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Login to the application
4. Refresh the page
5. Look for these logs:
   ```
   🔍 Layout mounted - starting authentication check...
   🔍 Calling checkAuth()...
   🔍 Checking authentication...
   🔍 API URL: http://localhost:8000/api/v1
   🔍 With credentials: true
   🔍 Trying /auth/me...
   ✅ Auth check successful: {user data}
   🔍 checkAuth() result: true
   🔍 User is authenticated, staying on current page
   ```

### Step 2: Test Session Persistence
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to any page (e.g., /dashboard, /resumes)
3. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. Should stay logged in and on the same page

### Step 3: Test with HTML Test Page
1. Open `test_frontend_auth.html` in browser
2. Login
3. Refresh the page
4. Click "Test Session Persistence" - should work

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### Check These Things:

1. **Docker Environment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend env | grep DEVELOPMENT_MODE
   # Should show: DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true
   ```

2. **Backend Cookies**:
   ```bash
   python test_docker_auth.py
   # Cookies should be Secure: False
   ```

3. **Browser Cookies**:
   - Open dev tools → Application → Cookies
   - Look for `session_token` and `refresh_token` under localhost:8000
   - Should be HttpOnly cookies

4. **Network Requests**:
   - Open dev tools → Network tab
   - Login and refresh page
   - Look for `/auth/me` request
   - Should succeed with 200 status

5. **Console Errors**:
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Look for CORS errors
   - Look for authentication error messages

## 🔍 Debug Commands

### Test Backend Directly
```bash
# Test authentication flow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}' \
  -c cookies.txt

curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/me \
  -b cookies.txt
```

### Check Docker Logs
```bash
# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Check frontend logs
docker-compose logs frontend
```

### Restart Containers
```bash
# Restart with fresh state
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📋 Expected Flow

### ✅ Working Flow
1. User logs in → cookies set
2. User refreshes page → layout mounts
3. Layout calls `checkAuth()` → tries `/auth/me`
4. `/auth/me` succeeds → user stays logged in
5. If `/auth/me` fails → tries `/auth/refresh`
6. If refresh succeeds → user stays logged in
7. If refresh fails → redirects to login

### ❌ Broken Flow
1. User logs in → cookies set
2. User refreshes page → layout mounts
3. Layout calls `checkAuth()` → tries `/auth/me`
4. `/auth/me` fails → tries `/auth/refresh`
5. Refresh fails → redirects to login

## 🎯 Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Docker containers running with `DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true`
- [ ] Cookies are `Secure: False` (not True)
- [ ] No duplicate authentication checks
- [ ] Layout authentication check working
- [ ] Console logs showing authentication flow
- [ ] No JavaScript errors
- [ ] No CORS errors
- [ ] Network requests including cookies

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **HttpOnly cookies**: Tokens not accessible to JavaScript
- **Automatic refresh**: Every 10 minutes
- **Session tokens**: 15-minute expiration
- **Refresh tokens**: 7-day expiration
- **Secure cookies**: Only in production (HTTPS)

The session should now persist across page refreshes as long as the refresh token is valid (7 days).
